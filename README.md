# Says-One-Neuron-To-Another

EECS 738 Project 3: Says-One-Neuron-To-Another
By Vivek Tallavajhala and Bisher Anadani

This goal of this project is to implement a neural network from scratch.
The formal requirements of the project are illustrated below:

Says One Neuron To Another
Neural network architectures
1. Set up a new git repository in your GitHub account
2. Pick two datasets from
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machi
ne-learning_research
3. Choose a programming language (Python, C/C++, Java)
4. Formulate ideas on how neural networks can be used to
accomplish the task for the specific dataset
5. Build a neural network to model the prediction process
programmatically
6. Document your process and results
7. Commit your source code, documentation and other
supporting files to the git repository in GitHub
