# EECS 738 Project 3: Says-One-Neuron-To-Another

# By Vivek Tallavajhala and Bisher Anadani

# Motivation
This goal of this project is to implement a neural network from scratch.
The formal requirements of the project are illustrated below:

# Requirements
1. Set up a new git repository in your GitHub account
2. Pick two datasets from
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine-learning_research
3. Choose a programming language (Python, C/C++, Java)
4. Formulate ideas on how neural networks can be used to
accomplish the task for the specific dataset
5. Build a neural network to model the prediction process
programmatically
6. Document your process and results
7. Commit your source code, documentation and other
supporting files to the git repository in GitHub

#Data
The data used for these projects came from UCI's machine learning repository. The first data set is the adult census income data set that allows us to predict whether income exceeds $50k/year based on census data.
The second data set is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. With this data we can use a neural network to predict whether a cancer is benign or malignant.
The data can be found in the /data directory, or can also be obtained from the following links.
Adult Census: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income
Breast Cancer: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data#data.csv

#Process and Results
The process and results of this project can be found in the python notebooks provided in the notebook directly. In these notebooks we walk through the process of coding the neural net from scratch, while also touching on some of the intuition behind building the neural net.

To follow the notebooks, we recommend first reading the adultCensus notebook while then looking at the BreastCancer notebook. This is the order in which we completed the assignments.
